# Mask-Detector-Deep-Learning-and-Open-CV-Project

### This project deals with Mask Detection, using Deep Learning model, trained using Convolutional Neural Nets, augmented with Open-CV, using Haarcascades for face and eyes detection.
### The Deep Learning model is trained using convolutional neural networks, with an accuracy of 97.78%, later storing the file in (.h5), and Augmenting the model with OpenCV, using Streamlit framework, When the user uploads the image, the deep learning model, with the help of OpenCV, predicts whether the people in the image, has wore Mask or Not, this project can be employed with a web-cam, using live streaming, and detect the people wearing mask, and not wearing mask.

## Please Have a look at the Working of the Project:
